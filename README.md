Amazon S3 is a cloud storage service that has the ability to host static websites without the need for handling any servers. Static websites are comprised of individual webpages that include static content and might also contain client-side scripts. By contrast, dynamic websites rely on server-side processing, such as PHP, JSP, or ASP.NET.
